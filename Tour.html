            <h1>Stonewall Site Information</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                The stonewall site is located on Lebenya Farm which is owned by Jan and Serena Coetzee. 
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">
                This site belongs to the Tswana tradition of Late Iron Age sites (also known as Late Farming communities) 
                that characterized the landscape between Johannesburg and the margins of the Kalahari from the mid 1600s 
                to the early 1800s. Various groups occupied this territory during this period. These sites vary from very 
                large to much smaller, like Lebenya. 
            </p>
                
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                The site has been studied by Jacqueline Jordaan for her Masters in Archaeology at the University of Pretoria. You 
                can download and read her dissertation 
                <u><a href="https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/55836" target="_blank">here</a></u>.
            </p>
                
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                The virtual tour covers a small portion of this site, please look at the location map to 
                view the areas that this tour covers in the context of the larger site.

                The site has been diagrammed to consist of three clusters of stone walling, representing the principal 
                family in the centre and others attached north and south of the main cluster.

            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                It is not certain, but the likely occupants were the Phiring people, whose traditions place 
                them not far from the Lebenya site.  
                The Phiring may have originally been part of the Hurutshe people, 
                whose settlements are located West of Lebenya.
