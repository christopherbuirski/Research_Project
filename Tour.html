            <h1>Stonewall Site Information</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                The stonewall site is located on Lebenya Farm which is owned by Jan and Serena Coetzee. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                This site belongs to the Tswana tradition of Late Iron Age sites (also known as Late Farming communities) 
                that characterized the landscape between Johannesburg and the margins of the Kalahari from the mid 1600s 
                to the early 1800s. Various groups occupied this territory during this period. These sites vary from very 
                large to much smaller, like Lebenya. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                The site has been studied by Jacqueline Jordaan for her Masters in Archaeology at the University of Pretoria. You 
                can download and read her dissertation 
                <u><a href="https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/55836" target="_blank">here</a></u>.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                The virtual tour covers a small portion of this site, please look at the location map to 
                view the areas that this tour covers in the context of the larger site.

            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                The site has been diagrammed to consist of three clusters of stone walling, representing 
                the principal family in the centre and others attached North and South of the main cluster.

                We are about to enter a household in the Southern cluster of the site that is a domestic space 
                where people would have carried out activities such as food preparation, cooking and sleeping.

            <h1>Cluster Organisation</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Each large cluster was enclosed by a boundary wall, and inside, in the centre, were located 
                the main cattle byres (also known as kraals) which are characterised by circular walls. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Between the kraals and the boundary walls the residents built their family units. These were round thatched 
                huts built up against a boundary wall, at Lebenya made of semi-circular stone enclosures.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Each family unit had a small pen for sheep and goats.

            <h1>Cluster Organisation</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Here we have a schematic view of a compound recorded by William Burchell in July 1812 at the site of Dithakong, 
                a southern Tswana town near present-day Kuruman and published in Burchell, W.J., 1824, Travels in the Interior of 
                Southern Africa. V II, London: Longman, Hurst, Orme, Brown and Green. 
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                This was a site occupied by the Batlhaping, a different Tswana group to the people that occupied Lebenya, but it gives 
                an idea of how space was organised in the compound. In order to show the structure, the drawing represents a cut through the middle. 
                The letters in the drawing represent the elements of the compound, and the names of the elements have been annotated on the side. The 
                outer fence, labelled 'I' in the illustration, is an outer stone wall at the Lebenya stonewall site.

                and then a cross-cut sketch of a hut containing corn vessels from the same household.

                These sketches were made by John Campbell, who visited the town of Kaditshwene (not far from Lebenya) in 1820 
                and were digitised by Jan Boeyens. Although the occupants of Kaditshwne would have been different to those 
                occupying the stonewall site at Lebenya Farm, the spatial organisation of a compound and elements within 
                it would have been very similar to that shown in the above sketches.

                The sources of these sketches is John Campbell's Diary of his Visit to The Bahurutshe Capital Kaditshwene in May 1820,

                The walls were made of stone and the walls of the round hut were constructed using clay, soil and cow dung, 
                and thickets of branches as to hold it place.

                It is not certain, but the likely occupants were the Phiring people, whose traditions place them not far from the 
                Lebenya site.  
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                The Phiring may have originally been part of the Hurutshe people, 
                whose settlements have been located West of Lebenya.

            <h1>Construction of the stonewalls</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                The stonewalls at Lebenya were constructed in several styles and of different heights indicating that the people living here came from different groups.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Most of the stones were pulled from a nearby quarry and they were arranged with a technique known as dry walling, 
                in other words without using any binding element to keep the walling together.
            </p>
        </script>

        <script type="text/template" id="purpose">
            <h1>Settlement Purpose</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Lebenya was probably the overnight residence of people who carried out agriculture, herding, hunting, and gathering in the 
                surrounding landscape. The outer walls afforded privacy for those within and as well as preventing wild animals from straying 
                into the settlement.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Below is an illustration of the much larger Tswana town of Ditakong, made by Burchell in 1812. Although the size of the 
                settlement is different, this is an impression of how Lebenya may have also looked like when approached from the outside.

        <script type="text/template" id="activities">
            <h1>Settlement Activities</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Grazing and watering of sheep, goats and cattle took place an hour or two away from the site, 
                while cultivation of millet, beans, melons was carried out in the most fertile areas nearest the site.  
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                This area is known for good soils. Hunting for meat and skins (for clothing) was also common.
            </p>
        </script>

        <script type="text/template" id="life">
            <h1>What was it like living in the settlement?</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Living close together required a system of regulating behaviour and resolving disputes, usually at the main meeting place, or kgotla. 
            </p>
        </script>

        <script type="text/template" id="food">
            <h1>What Food Did They Eat?</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Their diet consisted of grain, meat from stock animals, beans, melons, wild meat, milk from cows and sheep, and beer (bojalwa) brewed from grain. 
            </p>
        </script>

        <script type="text/template" id="expectancy">
            <h1>The life expectancy of someone living at the settlement</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Very few burials have been found from this time period, and none from Lebenya, but generally speaking it would be rare to live beyond 50 or so.
            </p>
        </script>

        <script type="text/template" id="rubbish">
            <h1>Where did the people dispose of their rubbish?</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Usually, each compound was swept daily and rubbish located in a special area, which could be covered by ash from the 
                fires. Archaeologists call these places 'middens'. They tend to be mounds from the accumulation and can be somewhat deep (up to one or so metres).

            <h1>Is there any future archaeological work planned?</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                Hundreds of sites like Lebenya are located in the region. Only the largest have been studied in depth, 
                but the work for just one site is slow, tedious and can take years to process the material 
                excavated to help interpret life as it was.

                Inside the settlement are located various sizes of animal pens (kraals) for keeping cattle, sheep, and young animals penned up overnight.
